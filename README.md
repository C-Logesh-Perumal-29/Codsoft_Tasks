**1) Movie Genre Classification**

  - The Movie Genre Classification project aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically categorizing movies into predefined genres using the textual information provided in their plot summaries. The goal was to enhance the efficiency of content recommendation systems and provide users with more accurate genre tags.

**2) Credit Card Fraud Detection**

  - The Credit Card Fraud Detection project employed a text-based approach, utilizing TF-IDF, to analyze transaction data and identify potential instances of fraudulent activity. TF-IDF, a technique commonly used in natural language processing, was adapted to transform transaction descriptions into feature vectors for machine learning model training.

**3) Customer Churn Prediction**

  - The Customer Churn Prediction project focused on developing a machine learning model to identify customers who were at risk of leaving a service or product. The objective was to leverage historical customer data to build a predictive model that could assist in proactively 

**4) SMS Spam Detection**

  - The SMS Spam Detection project sought to create a machine learning model that could differentiate between spam (unwanted or malicious) and ham (legitimate) text messages. In response to the widespread use of mobile communication, the project aimed to fulfill the demand for an automated system capable of sorting out unwanted and potentially harmful SMS messages.
